### Background
**Sharn** is a major city in **Breland**, a country in souther Khorvaire, and is arguably the greatest seat of civilization in Eberron. Trade flows regularly between the many nations and this place is widely considered to be a safe haven. **The Last War**, which lasted over a hundred years, ended only 2 years ago. Even with the war over, intrigue continues to exist everywhere. Sharn i sno exception; with the massive population and diverse cultures present, not everything is as it seems.

The **Dragonmarked Houses** provide their services to anyone with the right amount of coin. They also scheme and plot to further their own ends; some houses seek status, some seek revenge, some seek dominations; the list is tangled and intricate. The knowledge that the houses pursue their own agends is an open secret across the world.

In Sharn, fortunes are made and lost in the time it takes to caset a spell or crack a wand, and the romance of it all is a siren's call to more names than history will ever be able to record.

### About Eberron
Eberron is a D&D campaign setting that was released during the 3E era. While everything that exists in default / Forgotten Realms D&D exists in Eberron, they likely look / behave very differently. There are also new races and sub-races, with the Dragonmarks being of special note.
